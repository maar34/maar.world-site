<h4> Founder </h4>

  <p>My name is 𝐵𝓇𝓊𝓃𝒶 𝑀𝒶𝒶𝓇 𝒢𝓊𝒶𝓇𝓃𝒾𝑒𝓇𝒾 𝒞𝑜𝓁𝒶𝓈𝓈𝑜, I am a sound artist and engineer who works on transdisciplinary creations at the intersection of art, science, and technology. After studying Sound Design and Engineering in Montevideo and Santiago de Chile, I collaborated with sound and interaction design on many experiences including large-scale installations in America and Europe. Some highlights are the 2021 AI and Music S+T+ARTS Festival Hackathon award, the sound design of the Uruguayan Pavilion at the Venice Architecture Biennale 2021 and 2018 and the Uruguayan and Chilean Pavilion at the Milan Expo 2015, I was also lead developer in the artist-run initiatives <a href="http://headbrothers.com" rel="Head Brothers Home Page" target="_blank">Head Brothers</a>, <a href="http://headbrothers.com/exoplanetas" rel="Exoplanetas Page" target="_blank">Exoplanetas</a> and Aventures Sonores. For more than a decade, I have been assembling a unique archive of soundscapes, poetry, testimonies, native South American chants, radio signals, and a selection of eclectic music to create experiences that connect people and cultures through sound.</p>
