### üêö Perhaps the relationship between human beings is neither vertical nor horizontal, but orbital. üß¨

### What?
The "Interplanetary Players Orchestra" is a musical co-creation workshop, a creative and transdisciplinary space. During the workshop, participants work together to co-create a meaningful experience using meta-musical instruments and the design of their imagination. A meaningful experience goes beyond the immediate or the technical; it is a profound experience that creates emotional or intellectual connections among participants. The interplanetary players combine features of traditional and contemporary instruments in a digital interface accessible from multiple devices. The experience culminates in an exhibition showcasing the results of this collaborative process.

### Why?
The workshop arises from the need to explore different forms of interaction and co-creation. By inviting people from various fields to participate, it seeks to create a space where individual ideas and creations intertwine to generate collective composition. The central idea is that human relationships are not only vertical or horizontal but orbital, and this approach can foster new forms of expression and collective understanding through music and sound.

### For what purpose?
To promote the creation of an inclusive and experimental sound ensemble, where no prior musical experience is required, allowing participants to explore the infinite possibilities of music and sound in a collaborative environment. Additionally, the workshop aims to integrate artists, students, and the audience into a comprehensive art experience, using technology to synchronize musical creation with human movement and cosmic patterns, such as those of the planets in the Kepler-47 star system.
